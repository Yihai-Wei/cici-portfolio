    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      From an early age, I discovered my voice not merely as an instrument of sound, but as a vessel of emotion.
      Trained in the classical tradition of Bel canto, I have dedicated myself to exploring the depth, nuance,
      and expressiveness that this art form embodies. Through years of vocal study, stage performance,
      and collaboration with pianists and chamber ensembles, I have come to appreciate how music bridges
      the gap between discipline and imagination. Whether interpreting the works of Mozart and Donizetti
      or experimenting with contemporary compositions, I strive to communicate sincerity, balance, and beauty
      in every phrase. Beyond performance, I am deeply interested in the intersection of voice pedagogy and
      artistic innovation — how centuries-old technique can coexist with modern interpretation.
      As I continue my journey in graduate study, my goal is to refine my artistry, expand my repertoire,
      and contribute my voice to the evolving landscape of classical music.
